# Overview

Keychain is being built as a way to associate multiple wallets to a single on-chain account. The very basic
problem that it's being built for is to allow [Domination](https://domination.gg) players to sign in with one wallet
(such as one on a mobile device) while using NFTs housed in a different wallet (such as on a hardware wallet). However, 
we plan for Keychain to be used for several use cases such as:

- player profiles
- basis for a wallet-agnostic reputation system
- custodial (and transferable) wallet/account management

# Deployment

At the time of this writing, Keychain has only been deployed to devnet using the following program ID: KeyNfJK4cXSjBof8Tg1aEDChUMea4A7wCzLweYFRAoN
